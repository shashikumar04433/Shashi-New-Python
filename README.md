   ### To find whether String is 'True' or 'False'.
   eg1:

   eg2:
   
       shashi=" Shashi want to work hard in one field."
       print(shashi.replace('in one field', 'in many fields'))
       print('shashi want to work' in shashi)
       Answer:False//because where  's' in small letter in 
       shashi where as original it has Shashi so the answer is false.
